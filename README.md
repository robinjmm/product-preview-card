## About
This is my solution for the the challenge of building a Product Preview Card component from [Frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io).

The goal of this challenge was to re-create the card component as close to the provided design as possible. The card component had a simple, one-column layout on mobile screens and a two-column layout on tablets and desktop screens. The only interactable element of the card was the button. It changes to a darker shade of green when hovering over it.

## User Stories
The user should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements.

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- SASS

## Usage
You can download the project files by clicking on the green **Code** button, then select **Download Zip**.

Once you finish extracting, open the terminal, move into the project directory, and type the following code:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies.

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for any future changes, type the following code in your terminal:


```
npm run sass
```

To compile Sass into a minified version of CSS, run:

```
npm run prod
```
